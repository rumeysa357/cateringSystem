# Module 1 Capstone Success

## Success Criteria

**Does it work?**

*   Does it meet all the requirements? Pay attention to detail.
*   Do all the requirements work as described?
*   Are you able to add money?
*   Are you able to make purchases?
*   What happens if the user tries to buy a product that doesn’t exist?
*   What happens when the user runs out of money?
*   What happens when the system runs out of a product?
*   Does it keep running for multiple “sessions”?
*   Was it delivered on time? (Prior to 9AM Monday morning)

**Is the code clean? Is it understandable?** 

*   Good variable, method, and class names
*   Appropriate use of objects
*   Appropriate use of methods and return types
*   Good formatting and indenting
*   Appropriate use of public/private accessors
*   No static variables or methods except Main()
*   Good use of comments

**Is it well structured?**

*   Appropriate use of the OO principles when applicable:  Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism (especially Encapsulation)
*   Data exists in one place (not multiple places)
*   Functionality exists in one place (not multiple places)
*   Methods “return”, don’t call other methods in a circular manner (For example, don't call run() when you want to go back to the previous menu, etc)

**Is it testable?**

*   Methods do their work based on parameters and return a value
*   Minimum number of class-level variables
*   ALL System.out and System.in statements isolated in one (un-testable) module. The ONLY place you should have System.out and System.in is in your Menu or UI class. NO EXCEPTIONS. 

**What is not important?**

*   Clever code,
*   Additional features, no matter how amazing. Only code what is asked and nothing more.

## Code Review

Good code matters! So the project will also be judged not only on the functionality but on the quality of the code.   The code must also “pass” code review. During a code review, the code is examined for the following


### Code Review Criteria



*   Can you explain the code, including your partner's? Each person will be randomly presenting parts of the code to your reviewers. It is important each person can understand the code. Practice!
*   Does it align to OOP?
*   Does it make good uses of classes and methods?
*   Does it make good use of the language?
*   Does it have any errors that would cause it to eventually fail?
*   You may be given a different file than the sample one provided.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid


*   Not designing first!
*   Having System.in or System.out statements  in more than 1 module
*   Re-reading the inventory each time the items are accessed
*   Writing code that depends on having the same data in the input file each time
*   Not handling exceptions or having empty catch blocks
*   Not having separate class(es) for File I/O
*   After the transaction has finished, the balance of the is not emptied
*   Creating multiple instances of classes that should have 1, like the Catering System, Menu, File IO, etc.
*   Using a GOTO approach with menus that would eventually result in a Stack Overflow condition
*   Writing everything in UserInterface class
*   Having functionality repeated in multiple places
*   The Catering System quits after each transaction
*   Writing code that is not unit testable
*   Saving Unit Tests for the end
*   No Unit Tests
*   Trying to write everything at one time instead of dividing the functionality
*   Not pairing. You must pair on this project. If you must take a break, you can work on code separately but ONLY if you talk about it in advance, and review all changes made with the pair partner. 
*   Not switching roles. 
*   One person controlling what gets done for the sake of finishing faster.
*   Not communicating, especially concerning expectations and availability over the weekend. As a pair team, you commit to each other when you work and when you don't. Get agreement in advance and stick to it.
*   Not asking questions when you are stuck or don’t understand how to do what you need to do. If you can't solve a problem after a considerable amount of time, seek help.
*   Using online resources inappropriately. DO NOT COPY code. Do your own work. We reserve the right to (and often) run code scans using tools designed to look for copied code, or code found on the Internet.
*   Seeking outside help other than your pair partner, or the instructional staff. You can ask other teams for hints if you get stuck, however this is not a class or group project or designed to be done by your friend, the programmer. 
*   Trying to write everything at once.   Develop one feature at a time.
*   Did we mention not designing first or trying to 'solo' it. 
*   Not participating in the capstone is not an option if you wish to graduate TE.
*   Avoid frustration. Be positive at all times. If you need to step away and take a break, do so. You got this!
